# Overview

This time, I made a student managing system with python. As a database, I used sql. I had a experince to do sql and python before, but it was my first time to connect the those two system. Therefore I thought it would be hard, but comparing with my thought it was easier. To connect the sql and python, it was really interesting to using mysql on the python code. 

Frist, I made GUI to see the place to my code is worked. In the GUI, I can input the student's inforamtion I made a 4 array so that I can add student ID, student first name, last name, and years. After input the informations, I can do add, serch, or delete. If I do add, the information save on the sql database. And by clicking the serch, the saved data in the mysql is possible to see in either GUI or mysql. For the delete the informations, to easily delete if the student ID is matching, it made me possible to delete the data. 

It was really good chance to learn about the sql and python more. It was possible to save the data to the database.

# Relational Database

Employing MySQL for database management, I systematically input and organize student information, encompassing crucial details such as student ID, first name, last name, and year of birth. The process of incorporating new student records entails the meticulous entry of student ID, first name, last name, and year of birth. In instances requiring data removal, a streamlined approach is implemented, wherein the sole requirement is the input of the respective student ID for deletion purposes. This systematic and efficient workflow ensures accurate data management within the MySQL framework.

# Development Environment

I used the python and made a student managing system. If I adding new student, the data is going to the sql so that I can save the data in the sql. Also, to use sql, I used mysql.

# Future Work

- This time, I only made small database system that can only cover the student's informations. But I hope to make a big database so that I can handling a lots of datas. 
- I want to using cloud database so that I can save my data not only my server, but also with the any servers. So that I can access the data more easily. 
- This time, I did MySql with python. However, I want to using other computer language as like C++, C#.
