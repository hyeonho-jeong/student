# Overview

On this occasion, I developed a student management system using Python, incorporating SQL as the underlying database. While I had prior experience working with both SQL and Python independently, this project marked my inaugural attempt at seamlessly integrating these two systems. Initially apprehensive about the perceived complexity, I found the process surprisingly straightforward. The utilization of MySQL within the Python code for establishing the connection between SQL and Python was particularly fascinating.

To enhance the user interface, I implemented a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to monitor the execution of my code. Within the GUI, I devised a four-array structure enabling the input of student information, including student ID, first name, last name, and academic years. Post data input, the system facilitated operations such as addition, search, or deletion. Upon choosing to add information, the data was seamlessly stored in the SQL database. Furthermore, the search functionality allowed the retrieval of saved data either through the GUI or directly from MySQL. For deletion purposes, a streamlined process was devised, enabling the effortless removal of data matching the specified student ID.

This project provided a valuable opportunity for deepening my understanding of SQL and Python integration, culminating in the successful storage of data within the database.

# Relational Database

Employing MySQL for database management, I systematically input and organize student information, encompassing crucial details such as student ID, first name, last name, and year of birth. The process of incorporating new student records entails the meticulous entry of student ID, first name, last name, and year of birth. In instances requiring data removal, a streamlined approach is implemented, wherein the sole requirement is the input of the respective student ID for deletion purposes. This systematic and efficient workflow ensures accurate data management within the MySQL framework.

# Development Environment

I employed Python to develop a student management system, incorporating functionality to seamlessly add new student data, which is subsequently stored in an SQL database. In the process of leveraging SQL, I specifically utilized MySQL to facilitate the efficient management and storage of student information within the database.

# Future Work

- This time, I only made small database system that can only cover the student's informations. But I hope to make a big database so that I can handling a lots of datas. 
- I want to using cloud database so that I can save my data not only my server, but also with the any servers. So that I can access the data more easily. 
- This time, I did MySql with python. However, I want to using other computer language as like C++, C#.
